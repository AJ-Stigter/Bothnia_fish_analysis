# To recreate all steps, start in 1. Exploration
# First all fish data was  merged in: "Merge_fish_data"
# Then the fish data was explored and cleaned in: "Explore_and clean_fish_data"
# After this the fish data was merged with the different environmental datasets
#         For temperature and salinity: "Merge_temp_sal_fish"
#         For chla: "Merge_chla_fish"
#         For other environmental variables such as nutrients: "Merge_dbotnia_fish"


# To recreate analysis (GAM), start in 2. Analysis
# First timeseries was done in: "GAM_timeseries"
# Then all predictor variables were analysed
#         For temperature and salinity: "GAM_temp_sal"
#         For chla: "GAM_chla"
#         For other environmental variables such as nutrients: "GAM_dbo"
